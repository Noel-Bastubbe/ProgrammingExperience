Agentic systems are a new way to improve the programming experience for developers
by providing automated support for code generation, refactoring, and gathering information
about software projects. To use and improve these systems effectively, it is important
to understand how they work internally.
In this project, I explored programming agents using the open-source OpenHands project
as a case study, which enabled me to analyze the architecture and tool use of these systems
in realistic settings. To deepen this understanding, I expanded the capabilities of the agent
to see what is needed to implement new tools, how they integrate into the system,
and where potential problems can arise.
This work aims to contribute to a clearer understanding of programming agents and their role
in supporting developers. It also explores future directions for enhancing the programming experience
use agentic and multi-agentic systems.
